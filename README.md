# <BCS-Module-2-Challenge>

## Description

I designed this portfolio to not only satisfy the requirements for the BCS Module 2 Challenge, but to begin forming a project I can present to future potential employers. This portfolio will give me a landing zone for everything I want to display as my knowledge of web development expands.

The focus of this project was to display everything I've learned so far throughout our Git, HTML, and CSS modules. Bookmark this page and come back in the future to see what I add during our JavaScript, API, and other upcoming modules!

## Usage

Read the brief "About Me" section, then use the "My Projects" and "Contact Me" links to jump to their corresponding sections.
